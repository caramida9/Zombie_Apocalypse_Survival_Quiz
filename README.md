# Zombie_Apocalypse_Survival_Quiz
This is my first ever coding project from start to finish.

A simple, 100-question quiz made as a console application in C/C++. 
The quiz is supposed to rate your ability to survive in the event of a zombie apocalypse by evaluating certain attributes.
The quiz has no GUI, you answer the questions by pressing the number of the answer and hitting enter.
At the end you will also have to read some ints from the keyboard in order to advance through your results.
You can check the source code, or simply get and run the executable.
The quiz requires some time and patience. It also requires honesty, in order to get accurate results.
